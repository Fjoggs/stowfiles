My thoughts/general design notes from a washed up 1on1 player/mapper:

i find 'airy' maps to be interesting, and while i agree that it's probably too much right now in terms of scale i don't mind keeping it generally more open.
there's enough cramped 1on1 maps out there, so don't be afraid to be unique.

i would however tune down some of the "side"-atriums like the PG room. they feel like hybrid between an atrium and a hallway, and considering how ineffective a PG probably is on a map like this there's very little reason for a player to go there since you can navigate to the YA/RG stairway from the pillar in the middle with the little door.

i would consider ditching some of the teleporters. tp's are neat but they IMO make it harder to understand a map, and can disrupt gameplay. the teleporter near RA/RL for example could be a jumppad instead to make it more risky to get out quickly.
i try to limit myself to 2 teleporters on a 1on1 map unless it's a two way style teleporter like on cpm3 (very easy to remember where you end up).

spawnpoints:
when i place spawnpoints i try to weigh each spawnpoint equal so that they end up close in power level.
as an example, someone who spawns right next to RA or MH would be further away from a powerful weapon (maybe there's a shotty nearby).
a RL/LG spawn could have a green armor/armor shards close by, while a mid level weapon like PG/GL would potentially  then there's usually a yellow armor close by to make up for it.

I also try to aim my spawnpoints towards the most natural path someone will take after respawning, which usually means a "landmark" of some sort to help them identify immediately where they are.
this could be a RL for example, so the one spawn point you have close to the YA pit with the RL in the corner, I would turn the spawn point 45 degrees to the right, since the player is 10/10 times going to run for the RL first.

item placement:
RA placement is very similar to my own style (i like deadends) + the GL is placed well to allow for bouncing nades against the wall into the RA-room. however the ra-room is a bit too easy to get out of and is too big so i don't think it's gonna be particularly effective.
whoever's down there can probably get in and out too fast for the nades to do much

MH and RA room are probably a bit too close to each other? if you use the tele then you'll end up at the entrance of the MH room (with a RL), so if someone's down there (with a shotgun) they can't get out.

placing ammo right next to the weapon spawn is a DM classic, but I would place them separately and then use that fact to encourage players to traverse the map more. a box of LG ammo can sometimes be useful enough to force a player to go away from the important areas.

snipers nest is very thematic and i understand why the RG is up there but at the same time, on a map like this the RG is most likely completely overpowered. so much so that i'd assume you wouldn't use many other weapons once you get it.
I like to flip the switch on weapons like RG and instead of placing it where it makes sense to use it (like how you've placed the GL), i place it on the lowest floor, maybe even in a deadend.
it should be a big risk to go for an RG on a map like this
